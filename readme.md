 This is an implementation of an algorithm described in http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7989671/. 
 Modified the original code of  Niko SÃ¼nderhauf which can be found https://openslam.org/openseqslam.html
 The functions doProcessing, doFindMatches (doFindMatchesModified), doDifferenceMatrix, DefaultParameters are mainly modified.
 Other than these files, some parameters of the other files are modified.
 I used Flann libray for the Approximate nearest neighbour calculation.
 didn't implement the matching computation in the doFindMatchesModifed parallely so it may take longer time than the original
 seqSlam implementation which has implemented matching computation parallely
